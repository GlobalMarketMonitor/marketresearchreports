Fans never actually cool air, unlike air-conditioning equipment, but use significantly less power (cooling air is thermodynamically expensive). Conversely, a ceiling fan can also be used to reduce the stratification of warm air in a room by forcing it down to affect both occupants' sensations and thermostat readings, thereby improving climate control energy efficiency.<br /><br />This Commercial Ceiling Fan market research depicts the economic catastrophe induced by the COVID-19 epidemic, which impacted every company sector.
