It is created during coalification process where plant material is converted into coal over millions of years. In addition, CBM consists of pure methane, which is a clean-burning fuel, which contains lesser impurities and require minimal processing. It is considered eco-friendly than oil, coal, or even conventional natural gas.   The reduction in methane emissions associated with conventional fuels and coal mining, lower price of CBM compared to other unconventional natural gases, and generation of direct and indirect employment in the extraction of CBM drive the growth of global CBM market. However, the large initial capital commitment for well drilling, stimulation, and water handling, and the difficulty in estimation of recoverable volumes in evaluation of CBM proposals hamper the market growth. Key market players have adopted agreement as their key strategy to widen their brand portfolios and expand their market outreach.<br /><br />Moreover, this Coal Bed Methane market analysis report also exposes the restraints that may pose a hazard to the global market.
