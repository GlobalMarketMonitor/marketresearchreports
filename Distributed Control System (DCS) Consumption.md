A distributed control system (DCS), to control distributed processes or manufacturing systems, is a control system for a process or plant, wherein control elements are decentralized and distributed throughout the system. This is in contrast to non-distributed systems, which use a single controller at a central location. In a DCS, a hierarchy of controllers is connected by communications networks for command and monitoring. They offer flexibility, extended equipment life, simplicity of new equipment integration, and centralized maintenance when used in an industrial environment.<br /><br />Organizations may overcome the competition by designing effective plans and conducting competitive analysis using the essential data collected in this Distributed Control System (DCS) Consumption market report.
