Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) as also called refuse-derived fuel (RDF), is a fuel produced from various types of waste such as municipal solid waste (MSW), industrial waste or commercial waste. Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) consists largely of combustible components of such waste, as non recyclable plastics (not including PVC), paper cardboard, labels, and other corrugated materials. These fractions are separated by different processing steps, such as screening, air classification, ballistic separation, separation of ferrous and non ferrous materials, glass, stones and other foreign materials and shredding into a uniform grain size, or also pelletized in order to produce a homogeneous material which can be used as substitute for fossil fuels in e.g. cement plants, lime plants, coal fired power plants or as reduction agent in steel furnaces.<br /><br />This Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) market analysis report discusses about the estimated sale of the particular product and this helps market players to bring new product launches in the market and avoid committing mistakes.
