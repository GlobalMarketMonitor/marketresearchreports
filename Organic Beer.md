A beer can be called “organic” if it meets the following federal guidelines. Firstly, at least 95 percent of its ingredients are organically produced (e.g., no GMOs, synthetic fertilizers, pesticides). Secondly, the brewery must prove that the remaining ingredients were not available in sufficient quantities or qualities in organic form. And these non-organic ingredients must be on the federal Agriculture Department’s list of allowed and prohibited substances. There is also a kind of super-duper organic certification, called 100 Percent Organic, that means exactly what it says: Everything that went into the product, including cleaning and processing materials, was organic. Such beers are understandably rare.<br /><br />Factual estimation is included in this Organic Beer market report for the exact characterization of the business, market competition, projections for the business, understanding the objective of the market and rules to follow for making the business useful.
