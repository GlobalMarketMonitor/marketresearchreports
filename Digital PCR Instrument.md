  A standard Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is an in vitro method that allows a single, short region of a DNA molecule (single gene perhaps) to be copied multiple times by Taq Polymerase. Digital PCR is a breakthrough technology that provides ultrasensitive and absolute nucleic acid quantification. It is particularly useful for low-abundance targets, targets in complex backgrounds, allelic variants (SNPs), and for monitoring subtle changes in target levels that cannot be detected with real-time PCR.<br /><br />The whole situation that drives growth in the economy is covered in this Digital PCR Instrument market report, including challenges, factors, latest developments, restraints, technological breakthroughs, and possibilities for companies.
