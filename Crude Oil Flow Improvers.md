It is extracted from remote locations and needs to be transported through pipelines. Transportation of crude oil via pipeline is relatively difficult, owing to its viscosity and requirement of economical and efficient mode of transferring the oil. Thus, control over viscosity of the heavy oil is important for long distance transport without affecting the quality or state. Crude oil flow improvers maintains the viscosity of crude oil during processing and transportation. Moreover, it acts as additives that deliver apt solutions in all the stages of crude oil extraction from reservoir to refinery and maximize the production. These improvers are also known as drag reducing agents, which are injected into pipeline fluids to reduce turbulence. Moreover, these are employed on a wide scale among oil pipelines to increase the flow capacity and reduce the energy loss in pipelines.  The market is driven by the increase in crude oil production globally, to cater to the high demand, and rise in demand for crude oil flow improvers from the developing markets such as Middle East and Africa. Moreover, growth in hydraulic fracturing is expected to increase the demand for crude oil flow improvers. However, steady decline in crude oil prices and environmental concerns are expected to hamper the market growth in the near future. Furthermore, the production of crude oil flow improvers from renewable resources is expected to provide a substantial growth opportunity in the near future.
