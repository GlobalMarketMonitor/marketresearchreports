The economic scale of South America is relatively small and the macroeconomic development is slow. What's worse, the weak rule of law in parts of South America is not conducive to the economic development of the region. The slow growth of the macro economy will affect the spending power of consumers in South America, such as disposable income. As a disposable consumable, lotion tissues are not attractive to consumers with lower purchasing power. Consumers are more inclined to buy towels and other reusable substitutes. The South American economy is affected by regional politics, security, culture, and other conditions, coupled with the outbreak of COVID-19, all make South American economic development face some challenges. Economic constraints will greatly limit the development of the lotion tissue industry in this region.<br /><br /><br /><br />Changes in consumer behavior in South America <br /><br />Before the COVID-19 outbreak, consumers in South America have a higher preference for towels. However, COVID-19 is gradually changing the consumer behavior of South American consumers. After the outbreak of COVID-19, health issues have become a major concern for consumers. The medical infrastructure in South America is relatively weak, and health issues are particularly important to residents. Proper cleaning of hands is an important point. Although towels can be reused, they may contain bacteria and cause health problems. By using lotion tissues to wipe hands, bacteria can be transferred from the hands to the tissues. For this reason, during the COVID-19 epidemic, consumer use of tissues began to increase. As consumers in South America pay more attention to COVID-19 and hygiene, the demand for lotion tissues will increase in the short term.<br /><br />Following a review of significant and substantial corporations, the research focuses on the companies that are helping to drive market progress.
