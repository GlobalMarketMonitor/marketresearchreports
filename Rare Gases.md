Rare gases, also known as noble gases, refer to a group of chemical elements that belong to Group 18 of the periodic table. These elements include helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe). The rare gases have a complete outer electron shell, making them chemically stable and unreactive under normal conditions. This stability gives them unique properties and various practical applications. For example, helium is widely used in cryogenics and as a lifting gas, while neon is commonly used in signs and lighting. Argon is often used as a shielding gas in welding, and xenon finds applications in lighting, imaging, and as a propellant in ion thrusters. With the development of industrial production and science and technology, noble gases are more and more widely used in industry, medicine, cutting-edge science and technology and even daily life.<br /><br />This Rare Gases market report covers important market segments on the basis of type, application and region.
