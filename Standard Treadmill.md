A treadmill is a device generally for walking or running while staying in the same place. The belt moves to the rear, requiring the user to walk or run at a speed matching that of the belt. The rate at which the belt moves is the rate of walking or running. Thus, the speed of running may be controlled and measured. The more expensive, heavy-duty versions are motor-driven (usually by an electric motor). The simpler, lighter, and less expensive versions passively resist the motion, moving only when walkers push the belt with their feet. The latter are known as manual treadmills.<br /><br />This Standard Treadmill market report aids them in greater and better understanding product specifications in order to better design goods in response to client requests before placing them on the market.
