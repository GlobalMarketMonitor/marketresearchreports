An irrigation controller is a device to operate automatic irrigation systems such as lawn sprinklers and drip irrigation systems. Most controllers have a means of setting the frequency of irrigation, the start time, and the duration of watering. Some controllers have additional features such as multiple programs to allow different watering frequencies for different types of plants, rain delay settings, input terminals for sensors such as rain and freeze sensors, soil moisture sensors, weather data, remote operation, etc.<br /><br />All the information is compiled together with the help of primary and secondary research techniques.

In the United States, more than 34 billion liters of water are used for landscape irrigation every day. More than half of this water is wasted through over-irrigation due to inefficiencies in traditional systems. Growing demand for fully digital systems that can automatically change runtime and water usage schedules to suit landscape needs is expected to drive irrigation controller market growth in the coming years. Low rainfall in West Africa and India is expected to increase the demand for the product as the government initiatives to increase the use of drip irrigation and smart solutions are expected to increase the demand for the product. China's Comprehensive Modern Agricultural Development Project is expected to raise awareness about climate change agricultural practices and provide institutional support for improving irrigation systems in the country. There will also be increased investment in providing better infrastructure and new on-farm technologies, which will increase demand for products in the coming years.<br /><br />Many industry criteria and standards are covered by this data in statistical form, including capital, value proposition, demands for the products, and marketing technique.
